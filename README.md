# Machine Learning Demo Pack : Jupyter Notebooks for Aspiring ML Engineers, Data Explorers, and Cognitive Scientists

{ Introduction and Objectives will be here. }

## Getting Started with Jupyter Notebooks
Explanation forthcoming. 
Version: Python v. 3.7.6 and Anaconda 4.8.3. 

## Dependencies

NumPy:

```

## Notebooks (Coming Soon):

### Chapter 1: Linear Regression
Iterative linear modeling to find the line of 'best fit.'

### Chapter 2: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
A simple supervised classifier. 

### Chapter 3: K-Means Clustering
An unsupervised technique.

### Chapter 4: Na√Øve Bayes
A probabilistic classifier assuming feature independence. 

### Chapter 5: Decision Tree
A non-parametric, intuitive approach to regression and classification. 

### Chapter 6: Support Vector Machine
Script for a basic support vector machine. 

### Chapter 7: Simple Perceptron
A singular neuron capable of learning linearly separable patterns.   

### Chapter 8: Feedforward Artificial Neural Network
A network of neurons whose connections can be represented with an acyclic graph.
