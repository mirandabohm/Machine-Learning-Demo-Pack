# Machine Learning Demo Pack : Jupyter Notebooks for Aspiring ML Engineers, Data Explorers, and Cognitive Scientists

This series of Jupyter Notebooks will demonstrate eight fundamental machine learning algorithms. Each notebook is interactive and downloadable, with cells that can be individually manipulated and run to demonstrate various concepts. 

Some degree of knowledge of Python, including modules such as Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, is expected; however, it is not prohibitively so such that a beginner would have an impossible time following along. 

## Getting Started with Jupyter Notebooks
Version: Python v. 3.7.6 and Anaconda 4.8.3. 

## Dependencies

NumPy:

https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/install.html
```
! pip install numpy
```
Matplotlib (for visualizations): 
https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html
```
! pip install matplotlib
```

## Notebooks:

### Chapter 1: [Linear Regression](Linear_regression.ipynb)
Iterative linear modeling to find the line of 'best fit.'

### Chapter 2: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
A simple supervised classifier. 

### Chapter 3: [K-Means Clustering](k_means.ipynb)
An unsupervised technique.

### Chapter 4: Na√Øve Bayes
A probabilistic classifier assuming feature independence. 

### Chapter 5: Decision Tree
A non-parametric, intuitive approach to regression and classification. 

### Chapter 6: Support Vector Machine
Script for a basic support vector machine. 

### Chapter 7: Simple Perceptron
A singular neuron capable of learning linearly separable patterns.   

### Chapter 8: Feedforward Artificial Neural Network
A network of neurons whose connections can be represented with an acyclic graph.
