    "### Simple Perceptron\n",
    "A perceptron is the most basic unit of a neural network. Its mathematical design is inspired by the simplest unit of a biological neural network, the single-cell neuron. Thus, it can be informative to understand the way the biological system works in advance of tackling the math. \n",
    "\n",
    "Membrane potential describes the charge interior to the cell membrane with respect to the environment exterior. In a neuron at rest, this is equal to approximatley -70 mV (millivolts). Chemical activity at the synapse between the cell and its neighbor can trigger depolarization, an event in which the polarization of the membrane is reduced; the membrane potential thus transiently increases towards a neutral value of 0 mV. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the stimulating event is of sufficient magnitude, the potential will reach, and then cross, a value of -55 mV. This value is significant and known as the **threshold potential**, or threshold above which cellular behavior changes. At â‰¥ 55 mV, an action potential, or 'spike' in membrane potential, is triggered. This consists of a rapid increase and equally rapid decrease as measured over time. All of this occurs on a scale of about 5 ms. \n",
